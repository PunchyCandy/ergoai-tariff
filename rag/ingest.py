This module will eventually:
1. Load legal / tariff / customs documents (HTS chapters, Federal Register notices,
   USTR Section 301 lists, executive orders, etc.).
2. Chunk them.
3. Embed them into a vector store (FAISS).
4. Allow retrieval of relevant policy text for a given (hts_code, origin_country, date).

For now, we just provide a stub so the architecture is clear and importable.
